Purpose:

This project implements a Sudoku solver using Python and the pyautogui library to interact with a digital Sudoku interface (e.g., online game, app). It employs a backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution for the given puzzle.

I)DEPENDENCIES:
  * Python 3.x
  * numpy library
  * pyautogui library (install using pip install pyautogui)
   
II)Functionality:
1.isValid(board, row, col, c) function:
   * Checks if placing the number c at row row and column col violates Sudoku rules (no conflicts in row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid).
   * Returns True if valid, False otherwise.
2.Print(matrix) function:
  * Takes a 2D NumPy array representing the board and uses pyautogui to simulate keyboard presses, entering the numbers on the Sudoku interface.
  * This feature is optional and requires careful configuration to match the specific interface you're using.
3.solve(board) function:
  * Implements the backtracking algorithm to find a solution for the Sudoku puzzle represented by the input board (NumPy array).
  * Uses recursion to try all possible placements of numbers in empty cells, backtracking if a violation is found.
  * If a solution is found, calls Print(board) to display it (optional).
  * Returns True if a solution is found, False otherwise.
4.Main program:
  * Prompts the user to input the Sudoku grid row by row, converting input strings to integer lists.
  * Creates a NumPy array grid to represent the board.
  * Calls solve(grid) to find a solution.
  * Offers the user the option to solve another puzzle.

III).Usage:
 * Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed.
 * Run the Python script.
 * Enter the Sudoku grid row by row, following the prompts.
 * The script will attempt to solve the puzzle and display the solution (optional).

IV)Customization:
 * The Print(matrix) function might need adjustments depending on the specific Sudoku interface you're interacting with.
 * Consider error handling for invalid input or unexpected behavior.
